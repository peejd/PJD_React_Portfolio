# React Portfolio


## Description

This Development Portfolio was built using React.js components to render different component views, as a homework challenge for the Coding Bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill.

While it doesn't yet contain all of the components listed in the Acceptance Criteria, I did get the most important sections to render and spent a good deal of time getting the deployment to GitHub Pages working properly.

I plan to come back and finish fleshing this out to use as my primary online portfolio for job searches in the near future.
